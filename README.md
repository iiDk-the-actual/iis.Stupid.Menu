# 🛠️ ii's Stupid Menu  
ii's Stupid Menu is a **feature-packed** mod menu for Gorilla Tag, built by me, **iiDk**. Whether you're looking to experiment, explore, or just mess around, this menu has you covered. Designed to be **as useful as possible**, it includes a variety of features and options that let you customize your modding experience to your heart’s content.  

> Why settle for boring when you can have **stupidly good**?  

## 💡 Why Open-Source?  
Great question. The modding community used to be about **sharing, learning, and improving** together. But nowadays, everything’s locked behind **paywalls and obfuscation**. That’s not how it should be.  

By making **ii's Stupid Menu** open-source, I'm giving **everyone** the opportunity to:  
✅ **Learn** how mod menus work  
✅ **Experiment** with new ideas  
✅ **Contribute** to the Gorilla Tag modding scene  
✅ **Keep modding free and accessible**  

Let's bring back the **collaborative spirit** of modding. No paywalls. No secrets. Just **good code and great mods**.  

## 📜 Can I Use This Code?  
Yes! But there’s a catch—you gotta play fair. **GPL-3.0 License rules apply**, which means:  
- If you use my code, your project **must** also be open-source.  
- Give credit where it's due.  
- No shady stuff.  

Need help or want to collaborate? Hit me up on my [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/iiWasHere) or join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/iidk).
