# <img src="Resources/GitHub/cone-emoji.png" height=26px> ii's Stupid Menu  

ii's Stupid Menu is a **feature-packed** mod menu for Gorilla Tag, built by me, [**iiDk**](https://github.com/iiDk-the-actual). Whether you just want mods, are a developer, or anything inbetween, this menu has you covered. Designed to be **as useful as possible**, it includes a variety of features and options that let you customize your modding experience to your heart’s content.  

> Why settle for boring when you can have *stupidly* good?  

## 💡 Why open-source?  

Great question. The modding community used to be about **sharing, learning, and improving** together. But nowadays, everything’s locked behind **paywalls and obfuscation**. That’s not how it should be.  

By making this menu open-source, I'm giving **everyone** the opportunity to:  
- Learn how mod menus work 
- Experiment with new ideas  
- Contribute to the Gorilla Tag modding scene  
- ⭐ **Keep modding free and accessible**  

Let's bring back the collaboration of modding. No paywalls, no secrets, no malware, just good mods.  

## ❓ Can I use your code?  

Of course! But there’s a catch: you gotta play fair. **[GPL-3.0 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) rules apply**, which means that if you use my code:  
- Your project **must** also be open-source.  
- Give credit where it's due.
- No shady stuff.
- **[Follow the license.](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)**
