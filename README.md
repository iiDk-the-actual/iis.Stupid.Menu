# ii's Stupid Menu
ii's Stupid Menu is a mod menu for Gorilla Tag, created by me, iiDk. This menu is designed to be as useful as possible by providing any variety of features and options you would ever need. With ii's Stupid Menu, you can explore new functionalities, experiment with different settings, and enjoy a more personalized modding experience.

## Why make your menu open-sourced?
I made my menu open-sourced as a resource for anyone interested in learning how to create their own mods for this game. By sharing my work, I want to provide a valuable educational tool for the community, enabling developers of all skill levels to explore, understand, and contribute to the game's modding community. I want modding to go back to how it used to be, with everything free and open-sourced, unlike today, where everything is obfuscated and locked behind paywalls. By making my menu open-sourced, I hope to inspire a return to a more collaborative and accessible modding culture.

## Can I take code from this?
Yes, if you're following the GPL-3.0 license guidelines. If you're interested in using any part of my code, it must be open sourced. You can find my contact information on my [linktree](https://linktr.ee/iiWasHere) or in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/iidk). This helps me and you keep the project alive. I'm happy to discuss any potential collaborations, so don't hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions or ideas regarding the code. Come on, [you wouldn't steal a method.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMBqPdMzZ9E)
